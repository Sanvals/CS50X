Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The ones with a low chance of winning

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

At 1000, as there's already a stable result and it's the step before the computation time increases the most
