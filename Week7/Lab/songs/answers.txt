-- If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

My averaging their result and adding some statistical results to better correlate to the spectrum of the sogns.

-- Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

It will still not consider the songs with some distance to the average. A better way to depict the aura would be to create clusters of sub-auras by, for example, genre, and create a n-dimensional value for each user.
